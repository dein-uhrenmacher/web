			<h2>Uhrenmacher's Website</h2>
			<p>If you see this, your script reached the peak of the internet: </br>The site of some loser in this network, dein Uhrenmacher</p>
			<p> I have wraped my mind around JS and thought that it is not <b>that</b> bloat and evil ( unlike SystemD )
			as I thought. And since I got some pretty decent skills in working with Javascript it will be implemented, 
			you can view all scripts on my Github. Onion Link is in development.</p>
			<p> Since I did not made a real catergory for that, I will answer it here: I use <a href="https://artixlinux.org">Artix</a>
			( sometimes Arch or Void as well ), with i3,
			<a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>, qutebrowser and surf and i3status.<p>
